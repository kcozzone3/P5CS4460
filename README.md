# Is College Worth It?
We created an interactive D3 scatterplot visualization using a colleges dataset with the purposes of viewing whether a certain college may be worth its cost, either in monetary value or in effort required to obtain the average acceptance credentials, as compared to the outcomes of attending.

By default, we distinguished public and private schools. If looking for the details of a particular college, you may use the search bar or click on a point in the plot. The values for this highlighted college are then displayed on the right. We paired particular axes that may tell a story and help answer this question and multiple scatterplots to switch between.
